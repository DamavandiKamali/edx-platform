      <h2>IFrame Tool</h2>
      <p>Use the IFrame tool to embed an exercise or tool from any web site into your course content. For example, the tool below allows learners to experiment with how the shape of a triangle affects a line that is derived from the triangle.</p></p>
      <p>Exercises in an IFrame are not graded. To embed graded exercises, use a Custom JavaScript Problem.</p>
      <p>Modify this template as needed.</p>
      <p>To modify the IFrame, you must edit the HTML source code. When editing this template, click <strong>HTML</strong> in the toolbar.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Replace the value of the <strong>src</strong> attribute of the IFrame with the URL of the tool that you want in your course.
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: The URL must start with <strong>https</strong> instead of http, to ensure that the IFrame will appear in all browsers.</p></li>
      <li>Replace the value of the <strong>title</strong> attribute with the title of the tool. You must include the title for accessibility.</li>
      <li>Replace other IFrame attributes as needed. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/iframe" target="_blank">the IFrame specification</a> for more information.</li>
      <li>Replace the text between the opening and closing <strong>iframe</strong> tags. A learner sees this text if the browser does not support IFrames.
      </ol>
