      <h2>IFrame Tool</h2>
      <p>Use the IFrame tool to embed an exercise or tool from any web site into your course content. For example, the tool below allows learners to experiment with how the shape of a triangle affects a line that is derived from the triangle.</p>
      <p>Exercises in an IFrame are not graded. To embed graded exercises, use a Custom JavaScript Problem.</p>
      <p>The HTML format required to use the IFrame tool is:</p>
        <pre>
        &lt;iframe title="the required title of the tool" 
          src="the URL of the tool, starting with https://"&gt;
           Your browser does not support IFrames.
        &lt;/iframe&gt;
        </pre>
      <p>The width, height, marginwidth, marginheight, frameborder, and scrolling attributes are optional.</p>
      <p>Modify this template as needed.</p>
      <p>To modify the IFrame, you must edit the HTML source code. When editing this template, click <strong>HTML</strong> in the toolbar.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Replace the value of the <strong>src</strong> attribute of the IFrame with the URL of the tool that you want in your course.
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: The URL must start with <strong>https</strong> instead of http, to ensure that the IFrame will appear in all browsers.</p></li>
      <li>Replace the value of the <strong>title</strong> attribute with the title of the tool. You <strong>must</strong> include the title for accessibility.</li>
      <li>Replace other IFrame attributes as needed. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/iframe" target="_blank">the IFrame specification</a> for more information.</li>
      <li>Optionally, replace the text between the opening and closing <strong>iframe</strong> tags. A learner sees this text if the browser does not support IFrames.
      </ol>
